# StirlingEngineEfficiencyLab
Undergraduate thermodynamics lab determining the efficiency of a beta-type Stirling engine. Based off of Will Yeadon and Mark Quinn's paper published in *Physics Education* (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ac142c).

Contained the the repository is
 - A procedure written in $\LaTeX$, including an introduction to the theory.
 - A Jupyter notebook with a template for binning and analyzing the collected data.
 - An alternative set of Excel workbooks to analyze the collected data.
